        <h2>Who is Usain Bolt?</h2>
        <h3>Usain St. Leo Bolt was born on 21 August 1986 in Sherwood Content, a small town in Trelawny Parish, Jamaica.
            He is considered the greatest sprinter of all time and worldwide known as "The fastest man alive".</h3>
        <h2>Some of his childhood background</h2>
        <h3>Early on his life, Usain Bolt had already developed a passion about sports, as he spent his time playing
            football and cricket in the street with his brother, Sadiki. Later on, when he got to school, he began to
            focus on sprinting and did not take long to become the school's fastest runner over the 100 metres distance.
            At age of 14, Bolt won his first high school championship medal in 2001, getting a silver medal in the
            200-meter race. At age of 15, he got the title of youngest world-junior gold medalist ever, by winning a 200
            meters dash at the 2002 World Junior Championships in Kingston, Jamaica. Thus Bolt started becoming
            recognized as a potencial great sprinter.</h3>
        <h2>Bolt's biggest acomplishes</h2>
        <h3>Bolt received this title after winning 3 gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China and managed
            to kept it through his carreer by making history in a series of championships. Besides the 2008 Olympics,
            Bolt also won 3 gold medals at the Olympic Games in London and 2 more at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, what
            gave him a "triple-triple" (three golds over three consecutive Olympics). Through these Olympics, Bolt also
            broke several records in 100m and 200m races and got the still unbroken Olympic record of 9.63 seconds in
            the 100 metres. Besides that, the jamaican also have the record top speed in 100m with an average speed of
            37.57 km/h (23.34 mph), with a peak speed nearer 44 km/h (27.34 mph), which he reached at the World
            Championships 100 m in Berlin, Germany.</h3>
